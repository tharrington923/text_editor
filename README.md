# text_editor

This application was completed throughout the Data Structures and Performance Coursera class (https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-structures-optimizing-performance), one of the classes in the Object Oriented Java Programming: Data Structures and Beyond specialization offered by the University of California, San Diego

The project for this course is to build a smart text editor/processor that incorporates “intelligent” behaviors of modern-day text interfaces including autocomplete, flagging misspelled words and spelling auto-correct. In each module you’ll add a bit more functionality to your editor through the project associated with that module.

I have attempted to clearly distinguish between the code I authored and the code authored by UCSD.

For this project, I wrote back-end code for a text editor to provide text auto-completion, spell checking, misspelled word spelling suggestions, intelligent text generation, and calculate text readability measurement (Flesch Score). A majority of the code I wrote can be found in the following files:

src/document/Document.java
src/document/BasicDocument.java
src/document/EfficientDocument.java
src/textgen/MyLinkedList.java
src/textgen/MarkovTextGenerator.java
src/spelling/SpellingSuggest.java
src/spelling/AutoComplete.java
src/spelling/Dictionary.java
src/spelling/Dictionary*.java
src/spelling/AutoCompleteDictionaryTrie.java
src/spelling/TrieNode.java
src/spelling/WordPath.java
src/spelling/NearbyWords.java
src/spelling/WPTree.java

Note: All of the TODOs in the file were written by me throughout the course.
